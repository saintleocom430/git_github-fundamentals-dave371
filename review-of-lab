# Fundementals Review

## What I Learned
Majority of the things mentioned in this lab I already knew for the most part. For instance, a ***repository*** can be seen as a project folder. Or
how ***commiting*** is like a checkpoint and ***pushing*** is how you can upload the changes to the cloud. ***Pulls*** are also important, since it is how you can colaborate on changes within a project.

## What I Still Need to Work On
The only thing that I dont have too much knowledge with is ***forking*** a repository. I have never done it before, but I will definetly start looking into it.
